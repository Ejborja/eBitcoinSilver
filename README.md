eBitcoinSilver
 
Silver is the most unique and versatile metal known to man, utilised not only as a currency, or as a store of value, but also as a global industrial commodity. Silver is used in countless applications, such as applicances, computer hardware, cell phones, water filtration and medical supplies. Due to this, the available supply of Silver is reducing dramatically, yet our reliance on this precious metal is only increasing on a daily basis

The eBTCS team is employing these principles to deliver a tokenised version of BitcoinSilver, a soon to be released token, forked from the Bitcoin blockchain. eBTCS is a community focused token currently used as a store of value, but with involvement from our active community our 'eBTCS Elite' development team will be working to develop creative use cases in the coming months. Our biggest strength is that we are a community focused project with a strong and friendly community of over 6000 members

The ‘eBTCS Elite’ team consists of professionals from across the globe who share an interest in blockchain technology and have industry experience in business management and development, marketing, graphic design, user interface design, user experience design and software development. Our goal is to make eBitcoinSilver a platform that is broadly utilised by many people, in many ways. We envision eBTCS to be the most utilised and accessible e-token on the cryptocurrency market
